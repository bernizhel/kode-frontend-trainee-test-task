# KODE Frontend Trainee Test Task
### UX
1. While performing the 2nd step, show the loading monitor 1.0.0
2. Get all the users on loading and save the received data
3. There are two paths:
    1. If there's no error, show the monitor 1.0.0, sorted alphabetically, in Все tab
    2. If there's an error, show the critical error monitor
4. Entering a name or a nickname filters the output on the monitor
5. Clicking a tab filters the users to show ones with the specified position
6. If there are no matched users, show the monitor 2.0.2.Г
7. Clicking the sorting menu opens a tab to choose it from 2 options: alphabetically and by datebirth. Clicking on one of them closes the tab and outputs the users respectively
8. Clicking on a user outputs a component with his information (avatar, name, nickname, phone number, datebirth)
